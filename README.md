# DigitRead
Simple TensorFlow digit OCR model loaded on an Android app written in Kotlin.

## What is this?
  * Draw a single digit (0-9) and the application is going to try to classify which digit you drew.
  * I created a CNN image classification model in Keras, trained it on a MNIST dataset and exported it.
  * Java TensorFlow is running the model in the back-end

<em>I am clearly not a designer.</em>
</p>

### Why?
  * I wanted to learn Kotlin, creating and exporting Keras models and using TensorFlow Java backend
